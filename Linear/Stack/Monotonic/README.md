# Monotonic Stack

## Overview
The Monotonic Stack is a data structure that maintains its elements in a specific order. This implementation allows for efficient push and pop operations while ensuring that the stack remains monotonic.

## Features
- **Push**: Adds an element to the stack while maintaining the monotonic property.
- **Pop**: Removes the top element from the stack.
- **Get Top**: Retrieves the top element without removing it.
- **Get Size**: Returns the number of elements in the stack.
- **Is Empty**: Checks if the stack is empty.
- **Print**: Displays the elements in the stack from top to bottom.

## Implementation
The Monotonic Stack is implemented in C++ and consists of the following files:

- `monotonic_stack.h`: Header file containing the class definition and method declarations.
- `monotonic_stack.cpp`: Source file containing the implementation of the methods.
- `main.cpp`: Example usage of the Monotonic Stack.

## Usage
To use the Monotonic Stack, include the header file and create an instance of the `MonotonicStack` class. You can then call the methods to manipulate the stack.
