# Data Structure with C++

This is a repo that contains various data structure implementations and algorithms in C++.

# There are two main types of data structures: 

- linear and non-linear. Linear data structures store data in a sequential order, such as arrays, linked lists, stacks, and queues. Non-linear data structures store data in a hierarchical or networked order, such as trees, graphs, heaps, and hash tables.

## Some of the most popular data structures in C++ are

- Array: An array is a fixed-size collection of data elements of the same type, stored in contiguous memory locations. Arrays can be accessed by using an index, which represents the position of the element in the array. Arrays are useful for storing and manipulating data that have a fixed size and order.

- Linked List: A linked list is a dynamic collection of data elements, called nodes, that are linked together by pointers. Each node contains a data value and a pointer to the next node in the list. Linked lists are useful for storing and manipulating data that have a variable size and order, and for implementing other data structures, such as stacks and queues.

- Stack: A stack is a linear data structure that follows the LIFO (Last In First Out) principle, meaning that the last element inserted is the first one to be removed. A stack can be implemented using an array or a linked list, and it supports two main operations: push (insert an element at the top of the stack) and pop (remove and return the element at the top of the stack). Stacks are useful for implementing recursive algorithms, function calls, undo operations, and more.

- Queue: A queue is a linear data structure that follows the FIFO (First In First Out) principle, meaning that the first element inserted is the first one to be removed. A queue can be implemented using an array or a linked list, and it supports two main operations: enqueue (insert an element at the rear of the queue) and dequeue (remove and return the element at the front of the queue). Queues are useful for implementing scheduling algorithms, buffering, and more.

- Binary Search Tree: A binary search tree is a special type of binary tree that satisfies the following property: the value of each node is greater than or equal to the values of all the nodes in its left subtree, and less than or equal to the values of all the nodes in its right subtree. A binary search tree can be used to implement efficient search, insertion, and deletion operations, as well as to store data in a sorted order.


- Graph: A graph is a non-linear data structure that consists of nodes, called vertices, and edges, which connect pairs of vertices. A graph can be directed or undirected, depending on whether the edges have a direction or not. A graph can also be weighted or unweighted, depending on whether the edges have a value or not. Graphs are useful for modeling various real-world problems, such as networks, maps, social media, and more.
