# Data Structures with C++

This repository contains various data structure implementations and algorithms in C++.

## Overview

Data structures are fundamental concepts in computer science that allow efficient organization, storage, and manipulation of data. This repository aims to provide clear implementations of common data structures using C++.

## Types of Data Structures

Data structures can be broadly categorized into two main types:

1. **Linear Data Structures**: Store data in a sequential order
   - Arrays
   - Linked Lists
   - Stacks
   - Queues

2. **Non-Linear Data Structures**: Store data in a hierarchical or networked order
   - Trees
   - Graphs
   - Heaps
   - Hash Tables

## Implemented Data Structures

This repository includes implementations of the following data structures:

### Array
A collection of data elements of the same type, stored in contiguous memory locations. Arrays can be fixed-size or dynamic:
- Fixed-size arrays: Have a predetermined length that cannot be changed after creation.
- Dynamic arrays: Can grow or shrink in size as needed, automatically reallocating memory.


### Linked List
A dynamic collection of data elements (nodes) linked together by pointers.

### Stack
A linear data structure following the LIFO (Last In First Out) principle.

### Queue
A linear data structure following the FIFO (First In First Out) principle.

### Binary Search Tree
A special type of binary tree that maintains a sorted order of elements.

### Graph
A non-linear data structure consisting of vertices and edges.

## Installation

To clone this repository, run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/A-A7med-i/Data_Structure.git
```

## Usage

Each data structure is implemented in its own file. To use a specific data structure, include the corresponding header file in your C++ program.
